# Cache Coherence Simulator

This simulator covered the implementation of the following cache coherence protocols: **basic MSI, MSI + BusUgr, MESI, MESI + Snooping Filter**. 

The simulator can be used to measure the performance (memory transactions and bus signals) for instructions streams from multicore systems.


Guided by a lab from ECE506 at NC State University taught by Prof. [Amro Awad](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/ajawad/).
